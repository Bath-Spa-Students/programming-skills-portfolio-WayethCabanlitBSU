#Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

#Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

#Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
